# Using Cypress

## Important Notes

### Connection Issues

-   sometimes the hover will not work. if you notice the test waiting for something and then failing when trying to connect, it's most likely the hover glitching.
-   if this happens, hover over the connection bar yourself or retry the test until it works
-   i am not sure what causes this glitch, whether it is our issue or the function's

## Setup

### Environment Variables

-   example values located in `.cypress.env.json`
-   vars:
    -   `grbl_port` => port of your grbl machine, used for connecting
    -   `grblhal_port` => port of your grblhal machine, used for connecting
    -   `file` => path to the file you want to use
    -   `X+Y+/X-Y-/X+Y-/X-Y+` => keys for shortcuts, in the form `{key}` (ex. `{alt}{leftArrow}`)

### Running Cypress

-   start your server
-   set up your environment variables outlined in `.cypress.env.json`
-   `npm run cypress:open`
-   choose E2E
-   choose your browser
-   click on a test file to start running!

## Development

### API:

**https://docs.cypress.io/api/table-of-contents**

-   most common functions:
    -   `cy.visit` => visit a webpage. if no url is specified, uses `baseUrl` in `cypress.config.json`
    -   `cy.get` => find an element by id or class
    -   `cy.contains` => find an element by the value it contains (ex. `cy.contains('Save')` to get a button with the text 'Save')
    -   `cy.should` => make an assertion
    -   `cy.wait` => wait for a certain number of milliseconds
-   you can find by class by using `.`, and by id by using `#` (ex. `cy.get('#myid')` or `cy.get('.myclass')`)
